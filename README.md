# NEAR Fungible Token API Service

This service provides a simple Express.js API to transfer NEAR Fungible Tokens (FT). It features dynamic configuration to switch between `testnet` and `sandbox` environments and includes robust error handling.

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: For the complete setup, deployment, and end-to-end testing scripts, please see the companion repository: [near-ft-helper](https://github.com/Psianturi/near-ft-helper).

## Features

-   **POST `/send-ft` Endpoint**: Transfers NEP-141 tokens to a specified receiver.
-   **Automatic Storage Registration (NEP-145)**: Checks `storage_balance_of` and prepends `storage_deposit` when needed so the receiver can accept tokens.
-   **Dynamic Configuration**: Switches between `testnet` and `sandbox` using the `NEAR_ENV` environment variable.
-   **High-throughput Signing**: Uses `@eclipseeer/near-api-ts` MemorySigner with automatic nonce management.
-   **ESM + Node 23+**: Works on modern Node with native `crypto`; a small polyfill guard is included.

## Project Structure

-   `src/index.ts`: The main Express.js application, defines the `/send-ft` API endpoint.
-   `src/near.ts`: Handles NEAR connection initialization and account loading.
-   `src/config.ts`: Handles dynamic configuration for both `testnet` and `sandbox`.
-   `src/config.sandbox.ts`: Provides baseline configuration for the `sandbox` environment.

## Library & Compatibility

-   This service uses the community package `@eclipseeer/near-api-ts` (v0.1.x), which is under active development.
-   Automatic nonce handling is implemented and works under normal conditions; RPC error handling is still limited upstream.
-   The codebase is ESM-first. Relative imports use explicit `.js` extensions. Node 23/24 is recommended.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js 23+ (24 recommended). A guard polyfill for `crypto` is included but not required on Node â‰¥ 23.
-   Environment variable `MASTER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` set for `config.masterAccount` (format `ed25519:BASE58...`).
-   A deployed NEP-141 FT contract; set `config.ftContract` to that contract account.
-   For sandbox testing, run a local node (e.g., the companion `near-ft-helper`).

## Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the service directory
cd ft-claiming-service

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Configuration

The service uses a dynamic configuration loader based on the `NEAR_ENV` environment variable.

### 1. Testnet Configuration (`src/config.ts`)

Update `src/config.ts` with your testnet account IDs. The `masterAccount` must have funds and be the owner of the FTs you wish to send.

```typescript
// src/config.ts
export const config = {
  networkId: 'testnet',
  nodeUrl: 'https://test.rpc.fastnear.com',
  walletUrl: 'https://wallet.testnet.near.org',
  masterAccount: '<your-master-account>.testnet',
  ftContract: '<your-ft-contract>.testnet',
  // ...
};
```

### 2. Sandbox Configuration (`src/config.sandbox.ts`)

These values correspond to the accounts created by the `near-ft-helper/deploy.js` script and should not need to be changed.

```typescript
// src/config.sandbox.ts
export const config = {
  networkId: "sandbox",
  nodeUrl: "http://localhost:3030",
  masterAccount: "master.test.near",
  ftContract: "ft.test.near",
  // ...
};
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run for Sandbox Testing

Testing is performed in the `ft-claiming-service` folder, but it requires a local NEAR blockchain to be running. The easiest way to set this up is by using the `near-ft-helper` script, which automates the entire process.

### Step 1: Start the Local Blockchain (via `near-ft-helper`)

In a **separate terminal**, navigate to the `near-ft-helper` directory and run the setup script.

```bash
cd /near-ft-helper
node deploy.js
```

â†’ Leave this terminal **open and running**. It is now serving a local NEAR blockchain.

### Step 2: Run the API Server

In a **new terminal**, navigate to this `ft-claiming-service` directory and start the server in sandbox mode.

```bash
cd /ft-claiming-service
NEAR_ENV=sandbox npm start
```

â†’ The API server is now running on `http://localhost:3000` and is connected to your local sandbox.

### Step 3: Test with `curl`

You can now send requests to the API from any terminal.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send-ft \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "receiverId": "user.test.near",
    "amount": "500000",
    "memo": "Test from API"
  }'
```

A successful request will return a JSON object containing the transaction result.

## Running on Testnet (Default)

If you are not using the local sandbox, you can run the service against the public `testnet`.

```bash
# This is the default mode
npm start
# or
npm run start:testnet
```

## Security & Best Practices

-   **Authentication**: The current API is unauthenticated. For any real-world application, protect this endpoint with an API key, JWT, or other authentication mechanism.
-   **RPC Rate Limits**: The public testnet RPC (rpc.testnet.near.org) is deprecated and has strict rate limits. Always use https://test.rpc.fastnear.com for testing and development. The sandbox environment does not have rate limits.
-   **Error Handling**: The service includes basic checks but can be extended with more specific error handling and logging.


## Benchmarking

-   Tool: Artillery. Scenario file is `benchmark.yml` targeting `http://localhost:3000/send-ft`.
-   Steps:
    1. Start the server: `NEAR_ENV=testnet npm start`
    2. Baseline at 10 RPS: set `arrivalRate: 10` in `benchmark.yml`, then run `artillery run benchmark.yml`
    3. Increase to 50 RPS, then 100 RPS, repeating the run
-   Report:
    -   Include requests/sec, error rate, latency p95/p99, and notable errors.
    -   Paste the Artillery summary output below this section once runs are completed.

## ðŸš§ Upcoming Features (Final Bounty Requirements)

This service is being upgraded to fully meet the bounty's high-load requirements:

-   **High-Concurrency Support**: Scale signer capacity using `@eclipseeer/near-api-ts` by provisioning multiple access keys and tuning the in-memory queue to sustain 100+ RPS with a low error rate.
-   **Performance Benchmarking**: Run and document Artillery load tests on both sandbox and testnet, including methodology and results.
-   **Operational Hardening (optional)**: Key rotation and improved RPC error handling as upstream features stabilize.
